# The registrars office at Calvin Coolidgeâ€™s Cool College has another request. They want to send out a mailer with information on the commencement ceremonies to students who have met at least one requirement for graduation (120 credits and 2.0 GPA).
# Write a function called graduation_mailer that takes two inputs, gpa and credits and checks if a student either has 120 or more credits or a GPA 2.0 or higher and if so returns True.
