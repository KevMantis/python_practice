# Introduction

# The linear search algorithm checks whether a value is an element in a list by scanning the elements of a list one-by-one.
# The algorithmâ€™s iterative approach to finding a target value is useful in solving numerous search problems with unsorted data.
# In this lesson, you will learn how to implement the linear search algorithm as a function and use it to solve search problems in Python.
